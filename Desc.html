School: conjuration(creation)[acid]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: one missile of acid
Duration: instantaneous

<div><span id="Arcane_Mark_Id_desc" >
Name: Arcane Mark
School: universal()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: touch
Effect: one personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
Duration: permanent
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable. See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the same object (see that spell DESCRIPTION for details).

<div><span id="Dancing_Lights_Id_desc" >
Name: Dancing Lights
School: evocation()[light]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Up to four lights, all within a 10-ft.-radius area
Duration: 1 minute
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. You can only have one dancing lights spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit. Dancing lights can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

<div><span id="Daze_Id_desc" >

School: enchantment(compulsion)[mind-affecting]

Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one humanoid creature of 4 HD or less
Duration: 1 round
Saving throw: Will negates
Spell resistance: yes
Description: This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A dazed subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against it. After a creature has been dazed by this spell, it is immune to the effects of this spell for 1 minute.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Detect_Magic_Id_desc" >
Name: Detect Magic
School: divination()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: 60 ft.
Area: cone-shaped emanation
Duration: concentration, up to 1 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft). Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Spell or Object Aura Power Faint Moderate Strong Overwhelming Functioning spell (spell level) 3rd or lower 4th-6th 7th-9th 10th+ (deity-level) Magic item (caster level) 5th or lower 6th-11th 12th-20th 21st+ (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: illusory sounds
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Will disbelief
Spell resistance: no
Description: Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a ghost sound receives a Will save to disbelieve. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell. Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: Will negates (object)
Spell resistance: yes (object)
Description: You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.

School: divination()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 10 min./level
Description: You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the like-that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level). Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Duration: instantaneous

Spell resistance: yes
Description: A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level. An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one object or 10-ft. square
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: see text
Spell resistance: no
Description: A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.

Objects are not damaged by the spell. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile-two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature.

A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: ray
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Fortitude half
Spell resistance: yes
Description: A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

<div><span id="Reduce_Person_Id_desc" >
Name: Reduce Person
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 round
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one humanoid creature
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: Fortitude negates
Spell resistance: yes
Description: This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size. A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. Reduce person counters and dispels enlarge person. Reduce person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: You reinforce a weapon or armor suit to give it a temporarily upgrade or mitigate the fragile quality (see page 146). A suit of armor or weapon touched that has the fragile quality is not considered to have the fragile quality for the spell's duration. Normal armor suits or weapons subjected to this spell instead gain the masterwork quality for the spell's duration and their hardness is doubled. If this spell is cast on masterwork or magical armor or weapons, their hardness is doubled for the duration of the spell.

Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant
Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet. The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

Description: This spell functions like invisibility, except the effect only lasts for 1 round per caster level (maximum of 5 rounds). Like invisibility, the spell immediately ends if the subject attacks any creature.

<div><span id="Warding_Weapon_Id_desc" >
Name: Warding Weapon
School: abjuration()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, F (one melee weapon you are proficient in and you are holding)
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 round/level
Description: The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a defensive position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided by a martially trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed at you, but does not strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them. The weapon serves only as a defense. While it protects you, you can cast spells without provoking attacks of opportunity, without the need to cast them defensively. A creature with the Disruptive feat (Core Rulebook 122) can easily bypass this spell's defenses. You provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells against these creatures even when subject to this spell, though you can still choose to cast defensively.

<div><span id="Weaponwand_Id_desc" >
Name: Weaponwand
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 round
Components: V, S, F (a magic wand)
Range: touch
Targets: one weapon
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: When you cast this spell on a weapon, you cause a portion of the weapon to open like the skin of a partially peeled apple, revealing a space large enough to insert a single wand within. As part of the spell's casting, you can insert a single wand into the weapon, at which point the weapon returns to its original form with the wand held inside of it without negatively impacting the weapon's integrity. For the spell's duration, a character who wields the transmuted weapon is also considered to be wielding the wand as well. You can attack normally with the weapon or use the weapon as if it were the encased wand. If the effect created by the wand requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you may make the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its highest bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather than just a normal attack with the wand-doing so does not allow you to add the weapon's damage to the wand's attack roll, but instead allows you to use your skill with the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the spell. At the end of the spell's duration, the encased wand is ejected from the weapon. If you have a free hand, you may catch the weapon as a free action; otherwise, the wand drops to the ground. If the weapon housing the wand is broken or destroyed during the duration of weaponwand, the encased wand is similarly broken or destroyed.

Description: The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

Name: Bladed Dash
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: instantaneous
Description: Both Quantium and Jalmeray claim that this spell was born in their arcane universities. Regardless of the spell's origin, it quickly spread throughout the Inner Sea and beyond as spellcasting sword-fighters learned of its existence. When you cast this spell, you immediately move up to 30 feet in a straight line any direction, momentarily leaving a multi-hued cascade of images behind you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You may make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against any one creature you are adjacent to at any point along this 30 feet. You gain a circumstance bonus on your attack roll equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. You must end the bonus movement granted by this spell in an unoccupied square. If no such space is available along the trajectory, the spell fails. Despite the name, the spell works with any melee weapon.

Range: touch

Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless)
Description: The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance). A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
</span></div>
<div><span id="Brow_Gasher_Id_desc" >
Name: Brow Gasher
School: necromancy()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: touch
Area: one slashing melee weapon touched
Duration: 1 round/level or until discharged
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to deal a gruesome head wound. When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to the normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a free action to open a gash on the target's forehead that deals bleed damage equal to half your caster level. At the start of each of the target's turns, when it takes bleed damage, it also takes a cumulative -1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty reaches -3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss chance). When the penalty reaches -5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell's effects.

<div><span id="Darkness_Id_desc" >
Name: Darkness
School: evocation()[darkness]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, M/DF (bat fur and a piece of coal)
Range: touch
Targets: object touched
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. This spell does not stack with itself. Darkness can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

Components: V, S, M (a hollow metal sphere)
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 minute/level or until discharged
Description: Electrical energy floods your body, shocking the next creature that touches you. Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 6d6). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies against this damage. Each time the spell discharges, the number of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell's damage dice reach 0, the spell ends.

Duration: 10 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.

<div><span id="Glitterdust_Id_desc" >

Area: creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Will negates (blinding only)
Spell resistance: no
Description: A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect. Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Stealth checks.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Invisibility_Id_desc" >
Name: Invisibility
School: illusion(glamer)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
Range: personal or touch
Targets: you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)
Description: The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.

<div><span id="Minor_Image_Id_desc" >
Name: Minor Image
School: illusion(figment)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, F (a bit of fleece)
Range: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Effect: visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)
Duration: concentration + 2 rounds
Saving throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell resistance: no
Description: This spell functions like silent image, except that minor image includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Mirror_Image_Id_desc" >
Name: Mirror Image
School: illusion(figment)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 min./level
Description: This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. When mirror image is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment. An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).
</span></div>
<div><span id="Pilfering_Hand_Id_desc" >
Name: Pilfering Hand
School: evocation()[force]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: S
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one object
Duration: see text
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: yes (object)
Description: You create and control an invisible telekinetic force, manipulating it with either startling abruptness or careful deliberateness, allowing you to seize an object from an opponent or remotely manipulate an object. You can utilize this force to one of two ends. Abrupt Maneuver: You instantaneously attempt a disarm or steal combat maneuver against a target within range. Use your caster level as your Combat Maneuver Bonus, adding your Charisma modifier (bard, oracle, sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (magus, wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. This combat maneuver attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from its target, but casting this spell might. If you are successful, you pull the target object to you, and if you have enough hands free, you can catch it. Otherwise, the object lands in your square as if you dropped it. Careful Maneuver: You attempt a Disable Device check or a Sleight of Hand check to pick-pocket a target within range. This spell lasts as long as you need to accomplish the task, requiring your full concentration for that duration. Once you resolve the skill check, the spell ends. If you are successful on your Sleight of Hand check, you pull the target object to you as with an abrupt maneuver. The target gains a +2 bonus on its Perception check to notice the successful attempt.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Pyrotechnics_Id_desc" >
Name: Pyrotechnics
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (one fire source)
Range: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Targets: one fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube
Duration: 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave the smoke cloud; see text
Saving throw: Will negates or Fortitude negates; see text
Spell resistance: yes or no; see text
Description: Pyrotechnics turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level. Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. Smoke Cloud: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.

Effect: one or more rays
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: yes
Description: You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Area: cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: A rain of dirt, gravel, and small pebbles fills the area, dealing 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, this debris covers the ground, making the entire area difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rocks disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).
</span></div>
<div><span id="Web_Id_desc" >
Name: Web
School: conjuration(creation)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (spider web)
Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving throw: Reflex negates; see text
Spell resistance: no
Description: Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled. Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter. If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Web can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

Description: Until the end of your turn, you gain a +20-foot bonus to speed (or +10-foot bonus if you are wearing Medium or Heavy armor), your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you can move through the space of creatures that are larger than you are, but you cannot end your movement this round in a space occupied by a creature.

<div><span id="Daylight_Id_desc" >
Name: Daylight
School: evocation()[light]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: touch
Targets: object touched
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light. If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Dispel_Magic_Id_desc" >
Name: Dispel Magic
School: abjuration()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: one spellcaster, creature, or object
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless)
Description: The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.

<div><span id="Elemental_Aura_Id_desc" >
Name: Elemental Aura
School: evocation()[acid, cold, electricity, or fire]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving throw: Reflex half; see text
Spell resistance: yes
Description: This spell forms an aura of energy around you, damaging all those that come near you. Choose an energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Creatures adjacent to you when this spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of energy damage of the selected type. This aura has an additional effect, depending upon the type of energy chosen. Acid: Creatures affected by your aura take 1 point of ongoing acid damage per round for 1 round per three caster levels, and are sickened for the duration of the ongoing acid damage. Cold: Creatures affected by your aura are fatigued. A creature that is already fatigued suffers no additional effect. Electricity: Creatures affected by your aura are staggered for 1 round. Fire: Creatures affected by your aura catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444). Creatures adjacent to you are allowed a Reflex save to halve the damage and negate the additional effect. The aura's additional effects do not stack if a creature takes damage from your aura multiple times. You may only have one elemental aura in effect at one time. When you cast this spell to deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, it is a spell of that type.

<div><span id="Fireball_Id_desc" >
Name: Fireball
School: evocation()[fire]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)
Range: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Area: 20-ft.-radius spread
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: Reflex half
Spell resistance: yes
Description: A fireball spell generates a searing explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must ""hit"" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

<div><span id="Flame_Arrow_Id_desc" >
Name: Flame Arrow
School: transmutation()[fire]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a drop of oil and a small piece of flint)
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: fifty projectiles, all of which must be together at the time of casting
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: This spell allows you to turn ammunition (such as arrows, crossbow bolts, shuriken, and sling stones) into fiery projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Fly_Id_desc" >
Name: Fly
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, F (a wing feather)
Range: touch
Targets: creature touched
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless)
Description: The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Force_Hook_Charge_Id_desc" >
Name: Force Hook Charge
School: evocation()[force]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: close (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels)
Targets: one creature or object within range and you
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: yes
Description: You create a hook of force that strikes the target and drags you to a space adjacent to it. Make a ranged touch attack against the target; if the touch attack succeeds, the target takes 1 point of force damage per caster level. Whether or not the touch attack hits, the force hook drags you in a straight line to a square adjacent to the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints. If your travel to the destination is not blocked, you land on your feet, unharmed by the sudden motion. However, the spell does not guarantee you a safe landing space when you arrive. For example, if your target is flying or on a ledge with no room for you to stand, once the hook pulls you adjacent to the target, you begin to fall. If you use this spell with your spell combat class ability, you can make your melee attack from your starting position or your ending position.

<div><span id="Force_Punch_Id_desc" >
Name: Force Punch
School: evocation()[force]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: touch
Targets: creature touched
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: Fortitude partial
Spell resistance: yes
Description: This spell charges your hand with telekinetic force. Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum 10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line up to 5 feet per two caster levels. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (-5 feet for Large, -10 feet for Huge, -15 for Gargantuan, and -20 feet for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 feet. A successful Fortitude save negates the movement but not the damage.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Gaseous_Form_Id_desc" >
Name: Gaseous Form
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: S, M/DF (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
Range: touch
Targets: willing corporeal creature touched
Duration: 2 min./level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains DR 10/ magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Haste_Id_desc" >
Name: Haste
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless)
Description: The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple haste effects don't stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Hydraulic_Torrent_Id_desc" >
Name: Hydraulic Torrent
School: evocation()[water]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: 60 ft.
Area: 60-ft. line
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: yes
Description: You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you're trying to break-page 175 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook lists several sample Break DCs for various objects. Hydraulic torrent extinguishes any normal fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.

<div><span id="Keen_Edge_Id_desc" >
Name: Keen Edge
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one weapon or 50 projectiles, all of which must be together at the time of casting
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

<div><span id="Lightning_Bolt_Id_desc" >
Name: Lightning Bolt
School: evocation()[electricity]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (fur and a glass rod)
Range: 120 ft.
Area: 120-ft. line
Duration: instantaneous
Saving throw: Reflex half
Spell resistance: yes
Description: You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Magic_Weapon,_Greater_Id_desc" >
Name: Magic Weapon, Greater
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets: one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)
Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic. Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Monstrous_Physique_I_Id_desc" >
Name: Monstrous Physique I
School: transmutation(polymorph)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to assume)
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
Description: When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the monstrous humanoid type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and scent. If the form you assume has the aquatic subtype, you gain the aquatic and amphibious subtypes. Small monstrous humanoid: If the form you take is that of a Small monstrous humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural armor bonus. Medium monstrous humanoid: If the form you take is that of a Medium monstrous humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +2 natural armor bonus.

<div><span id="Phantom_Steed_Id_desc" >
Name: Phantom Steed
School: conjuration(creation)[]
Casting time: 10 minutes
Components: V, S
Range: 0 ft.
Effect: one quasi-real, horselike creature
Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it. The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level. These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. 8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. 10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability). 12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. 14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.

Components: V, S, M (a drop of sweat)
Range: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: ray
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell resistance: yes
Description: A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued. A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Shining_Cord_Id_desc" >
Name: Shining Cord
School: evocation()[force]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a small length fine of silver chain worth 100 gp)
Range: 30 ft.
Targets: 1 creature
Duration: 1 round/level or instantaneous (see below)
Saving throw: Fortitude partial (see below)
Spell resistance: yes
Description: When you cast this spell, you make a ranged touch attack against a single opponent within 30 feet. If you hit, a thin silver strand extends from your body to its, forming a connection that allows you to anticipate its actions. For the duration of the spell, you receive a +5 insight bonus on all Perception and Sense Motive checks opposed by the target. You gain a +5 insight bonus on all Spellcraft checks made to identify your opponent's spell as part of a counterspelling attempt. Finally, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks made against you by the target. Lastly, if either you or the target moves more than 30 feet away from the other, the cord crackles with a surge of light and sends a blast of force along its length to the other end. This blast deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6) and stuns the one who moved out of range for 1 round-a successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. This blast ends the spell and severs the connection between you and your target. Although the shining cord makes a visible connection between you and your target, creatures can move through it without ill effect. The cord even passes through solid objects as necessary to maintain the connection between you and the target.

Range: long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Area: cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: no
Description: Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

<div><span id="Slow_Id_desc" >
Name: Slow
School: transmutation()[]
Casting time: 1 standard action

Targets: one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Will negates
Spell resistance: yes
Description: An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed. Multiple slow effects don't stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.
</span></div>
<div><span id="Stinking_Cloud_Id_desc" >
Name: Stinking Cloud
School: conjuration(creation)[]
Casting time: 1 standard action
Components: V, S, M (a rotten egg or cabbage leaves)
Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Fortitude negates; see text
Spell resistance: no
Description: Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect. Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent stinking cloud dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

Components: V, S, M (a cocoon tied with string)
Range: personal
Targets: you
Duration: 1 minute/level
Description: For the duration of this spell, your vital organs writhe, shift, and move about, making it difficult to strike you in a vulnerable area. While this spell is in effect, critical hits and sneak attacks against you have a 25% chance of failing to inflict any additional damage-though you still take the normal damage from the attack. At 7th level, the chance to ignore additional damage increases to 50%, while at 13th level the chance increases to 75%.

Duration: instantaneous/1 hour; see text
Saving throw: none
Spell resistance: yes
Description: You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.

Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell resistance: yes (harmless, object)
Description: You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire. This spell functions like greater magic weapon, except that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.
